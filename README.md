LHL prep course (section 1-2)

allows students apply their newly found knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript. My website consist of a recipe of "Chana Masala", 
a traditional dish found in the Punjab region, and basically walks the "to be chef" through the meal's raw ingredients and
the cooking instructions!
